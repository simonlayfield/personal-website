I have knitted all my life; almost. I have a doll called Dorothy who still wears a jacket knitted by my grandmother who sat making it with me at her side. Me wishing so much that I could knit like her.

But I first learned to machine knit when my daughter was just a few weeks old and I was living in Virginia for a year. I went looking for yarn in the only local wool shop to find that synthetic fibre was best they could offer. The kind lady assistant however, pointed me in the direction of a local farmer’s wife who she knew spun wool from her own sheep. Off I went and found a lovely lady called Carter Howard who did indeed spin her own wool . She also made a living in her immense studio by weaving wonderful wall hangings in fabulous textures and hand dyed colours of natural wool fibre.
She invited me to a craft club and there I met Peggy. Peggy had taught knitting in New York but had moved to Virginia with her husband a few years before.

Peggy took me under her wing and exchanged lessons for knitting. She was putting together a collection of knitted garments to be shown in Hawaii. So every morning Peggy would call for me and off we would go in her magnificent white shiny Cadillac with a fabulous white leather interior which smelled of new handbags. Peggy smoked so she would drive with her left hand high on the huge wheel and her “light-up” between her first two fingers. First stop was always the drive in; an exciting new experience for me at the time; where we would purchase strong black coffee which came in enormous red and white cardboard cups. Peggy managed to hold her cup in her left hand steadying the lower right side of the wheel at the same time with her wrist. We drove in this manor up into the mountains where she lived, Peggy taking alternate puffs from one side and sips from the other.

Peggy’s house was a massive wooden affair surrounded by a gigantic double story deck on the edge of an enormous lake about fifteen miles from our tiny apartment in Charlottesville. It seemed to me that every room in the whole house was dominated by some sort of knitting machine already set up and ready to go. For a whole year I came and went in the white Cadillac. Its registration number was K NIT. So all these years on I remember the sunshine and the breeze through the open windows, the smells of clean leather and coffee, and the thrill of Peggy’s yarn store which overflowed with the biggest stock of natural fibres in dozens of shades all ready to be transformed into something fabulously wearable.

I dedicate the first three groups of K nit designs to dear Peggy.

1. The Cadillac. White, black, gun metal,  pops of silver and Peggy’s pink dress.

2. Peggy’s dog. A beautiful Alsatian bitch called Jessica. We drove out to feed her and spend some time playing by the lake with her when Peggy went away. Brown, grey, greens, orange, denim blue.
Dark red.

3. Peggy herself.  Peggy loved to wear pink. Not in a Barbara Cartland sort of way but she would turn up with her short dark hair matching her black pumps with just a block of pink shift dress between . She looked like a small roadside flower. All pinks, black , grey, pops of turquoise, green, lemon, red.
