Bearwood Poster is an all caps font with authentic vintage charm. An unashamedly raw digitization of condensed type found on vintage playbill posters as part of my project, [The Salvagist](https://thesalvagist.com).

The font itself is intentionally inconsistent. I've found when digitising vintage typographic posters that lettering from poster to poster is just that. A slapdash mix of sizing and spacing, thick and thin, long, short, tall and wide.

I had some fun putting Bearwood together. It's been something I've had on my list of personal goals for some time, and allowed me to learn the basics of font creation software. If you have any feedback, <a
