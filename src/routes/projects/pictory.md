[Pictory](http://thevoidgenerator.eu-4.evennode.com/) is a web app concept that allows users to generate short stories of 600 characters or less based on a random selection of abstract ink compositions.

The compositions had to be abstract enough to be interpreted a number of ways across a number of stories, but also contain enough random contextual detail (incidentally if you like this style then check out the work of [Franz Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kline)).
