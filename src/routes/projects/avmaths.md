I was lucky towards the end of 2018 to become involved with the upcoming app design for AvMaths - a pilot theory test application that acts as a preparatory basic mathematics/physics training resource for aspiring pilots. Initial screens were drafted based on a basic quiz-style prototype, including brand concept and improved navigation/UI elements.

The project aims to undergo development in mid-2019.
