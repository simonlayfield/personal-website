  <div class="overview svelte-1gwtyoy"><span class="hook-name">allRequests</span> : allRequests which represents all of the request objects have been collected from route and plugins. This makes the &#39;allRequests&#39; array mutable.</div>
  <div class="use svelte-1gwtyoy"><p>The main use here is to allow users to adjust the requests that Elder.js is aware of.</p><ul>
    <li>This could be used for incremental builds. By filtering and overwriting the allRequests array building just a single route or even a single request is doable.</li>
    <li>This hook is used by elderjs-plugin-random to register temporary requests that it later intercepts to redirect to a random page of a route.</li>
    <li>This hook is used by elderjs-plugin-markdown to register processed markdown files and their slugs Elder.js</li>
    </ul><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are modifying 'allRequests' you <strong>must</strong> set 'request.route' key for each request.</p></div>
