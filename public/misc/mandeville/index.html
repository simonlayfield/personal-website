        <h1>Mandeville</h1>
        <p>
          I wanted to see if I could strike right balance between the different
          styles you referenced, so decided to have a crack at creating a
          handwritten script typeface.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by trying a few different styles.

          As you can see I tried a few different things, some that ended up a
          bit too Sleepy Hollow (3), or mid-century (4).
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose the one that was closest to what I wanted (2), and refined it
          a little.

          This is still rough, but if you like where it's going then I can
          polish it up some more! Also let me know if I got the right balance -
          is this too genre-specific do you think?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not keen on it of course that's totally fine. I think the
          next step in that case is to perhaps try some existing typefaces and
          see what suits.

        <p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
        <p>
          I've addressed each of the points in your feedback. The 'a' and 'n'
          have been cleaned up a bit to make them a little more distinct as
          separate letters. The weight of the script has been reduced, the
          underline brought in tighter, and there have been a few other minor
          tweaks to the flow of the script (the counters in the d and l
          letterforms, for example).
        </p>
        <p>
          The GUITARS type I'm ok with considering it would be there as an
          addition only in some cases and so I think the fact it sticks out a
          bit is...well, kind of the point. Still, I figured we'd start here and
          then maybe try a few options if you don't think that works.
