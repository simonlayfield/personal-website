  <small>By Nick Reese</small></div>

<p>One of the most popular use cases of static site generators is to build a blog.</p>
<p>So we figured why not offer a blog right out of the box on the starter template?</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to customize your Elder.js blog.</p>
<h2 id="this-page-is-editable">This Page is Editable</h2>
<p>If you've gotten this starter template running, then chances are you know what markdown is. If you don't here is <a href="https://medium.com/@itsjzt/beginner-guide-to-markdown-229adce30074">a good beginner's guide to it.</a></p>
<p>With that out of the way, let's talk about how you'll edit pages on your blog.</p>
<p>To start, open up the markdown file powering this page at: <code>./src/routes/blog/how-to-build-a-blog-with-elderjs.md</code></p>
<p>Once you've got it open, make some small changes, save the file and restart the server.
When you reload this page you should see your changes.</p>
<h2 id="adding-markdown-files">Adding Markdown Files</h2>
<p>Once you've edited this page, try duplicating and renaming one of the files in the <code>./src/routes/blog/</code> folder. Give the new file name anything you'd like.</p>
<p>Once you've done that, restart the server (or let it restart if you are using the <code>npm run dev:server</code> command) and then navigate to the homepage. Boom! You should see your new blog entry.</p>
<p>It is really that simple.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-your-design">Customizing Your Design</h2>
<p>Without making this guide 1000s of words long, basically all templating and design for this site is done using Svelte.</p>
<p>This page is being built with a Svelte template that lives at <code>./src/routes/blog/Blog.svelte</code>. There is also a components folder at ``./src/components/` where you can add reusable components.</p>
<p>Svelte files in either of these locations will be bundled by the default Rollup.js included with this script. (run by typing <code>npm run dev:rollup</code>).</p>
<p>Customizing your design is up to you, but in general if you're comfortable with JS/CSS/HTML you'll love the beauty that Svelte brings to the development workflow.</p>
