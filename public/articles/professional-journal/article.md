## Notes and musings, largely unedited

I heard Stephen King recently say [in an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR7XMkjDGw0) that the way he manages to write so many books in such a short space of time is to try to get at least 4 hours of writing done a day (which equates to 6 pages).

I can't promise 4 hours a day (yeesh!) but I can commit to maintaining a steady stream of research, theory and practical learnings.

Buckle up.

### The Seed

When applying for my MA Degree in Illustration at Notts Trent University I wanted to show that the last 5-10 years I had spent focused on web development could be recalibrated and focused on design problems, specifically using illustration as a medium.

I spent two days throwing together 'The Gendojack Series', a crude concept that illustrates how configurations of shapes can illustrate variations in the meaning of a word.

<figure markdown="1">

</figure>

This concept is shamelessly simple and was really only produced to illustrate a concept. Still, the seed of the idea  was enough to get me thinking about languages, in particular:

- **Computer generated visual languages** (I guess these exist??)
- **How languages have evolved over time and why they have evolved in particular ways**
- **Aspects of languages that are shared across existing social/cultural boundaries**

My first steps will be to investigate further on these points and explore the ideas that come from my findings.

## People to research

### Paul Rand
The only knowledge I have of Paul Rand is that he designed the NeXT logo for Steve Jobs in the late 80s and was a major influence on 50s and 60s graphic design standards.

### David Carson
Broke the rules that had been set as industry standard by figures such as a Rand.

### Victor Papernack
Another influential figure in design.

I've purchased the book **'Alphabetical: How every letter tells a story'** by Michael Rosen. Extracts:

[Page 2]

> The letter A began it's life upside down (as we know it) in 1800BCE. By 1000BCE speed writing saw it rotated on it's side. The Greeks flipped it to allow for writing from left to right and the Romans rotated it further to give us the letterform we know today.

[Page 11]

> "...the ancient Sumarians, from what is now present day Iraq, developed a way of using symbols to represent syllables. An analogy would be if we had a symbol for a bird's beak or 'bill' based on a picture of a bird's bill. This 'bill' symbol could be used again and again in a word like 'building' (where our 'buil-' sounds the same as 'bill'), or in 'possible' (where our '-ble sounds like 'bill'). Another way to imagine the 'syllabic principle' is to think of the possibility of us using the ampersand, '&', to write 'hand' as 'h&'."..."In terms of trade, pictograms are an easier way to translate words because you don't have to use abstract symbols like 'h' or 'y' representing sounds in different languages. The pictogram for 'eye' will work for my word for 'eye' just as well as your word for 'eye', each of which may well sound completely different."

<p class="marker lbm" markdown="1">reflection</p>

Language, to me, has always seemed such an _officially_ documented collection of _approved_ words and _slang_ the unofficial dregs leftover. Over time language evolves, but who are these officiators? How do words become officially accepted as part of a language?

The above passage indicates that in ancient times there were radical ideas about how a language should be used by society, presumably because it was a time of radical changes in society itself; economic growth, trade etc. Are there future radical changes that might necessitate further radical shifts in the way we use language?

Examples of symbols and pictographs we might see every day in signage. Perhaps the least familiar is the ['H' sign](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fire_hydrant_UK.jpg) which indicates to members of the fire department the details of the corresponding hydrant (this was news to me).

I also purchased the book **'Philographics: Big ideas in simple shapes'** by Genis Carreras.

This concept is quite interesting because it shows that even complex concepts can be represented by simple shapes.

This morning I was flicking through **'How to read pattern: A crash course in textile design'** by Clive Edwards, which sparked an interesting challenge in the representation of objects as symbols. For instance, take this pattern example:

<figure markdown="1">
![alt text](book-how-to-read-pattern-002.jpg)
</figure>

The caption describes this pattern symbol as a screw top *or* a coffee bean. If this symbol were being used as part of a language to represent either one of these things then how would we know which one it represents? This isn't too different from the way the written (English) language contains words that can mean different things depending on their context.

**'Alphabetical: How every letter tells a story'** by Michael Rosen [Page 4]
> 'Ah!' is a very useful sound. It can mean many things depending on the notes you hit as you say it. You can indicate that you're surprised, that you knew it all along, that you're satisfied, that you've been hurt, that you're sympathetic, or you're pretending to be sympathetic, that you've caught someone out and so on.

Could there be _shared_ symbols with a way to distinguish between it's translation. This was originally the intention behind the Gendojack Series. **The same symbol can mean different things depending on it's rotation**. If not rotation then perhaps some visual key. Numbers maybe?

Today was spent at EGX, a gaming exhibition in Birmingham. My friend, John Evelyn, was exhibiting his game 'The Collage Atlas' there and during the course of the day I played a bunch of other indie games that were inspiring in one way or another.

<figure markdown="1">

</figure>

You can see the dreamy introduction sequence [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_nlkH1Tr8E).

What I found interesting about John's game (and incidentally about other indie games in general) was that they're all trying to _teach_ you something. Whether the learning is part of the actions within the game itself, or whether the learning was something **external from the game** did vary - for instance - I played an indie game that encouraged the user to be part of the story itself by rewriting the game's narrative. Thus I learned to co-create a story. I played another game that allowed the user to choose from different astrology outcomes as an astrologer in Shakesperian London. Thus I learned (briefly) about astrology. The medium of gaming is a pretty powerful vehicle for learning.

This did open my mind up to the idea of researching gamification as a vehicle for education. Is it easier for people to learn a language, for instance, if they have a game-related incentive?

Also, I was stunned by how much raw creativity I found within a medium that mostly known as being self-contained within the games themselves. Contrary to that, I saw a LOT of raw/offline art to support the digital/game based art and direction. There was a physical _paper shredder_ characterised within a game that required the user to feed through paper in order to advance the story.

Really inspiring stuff and opened me up to the idea of using games as a means of discovery.

_Disclaimer: If you like galleries, I'm sorry. I have no idea what I'm talking about._

Yesterday, I went to see the exhibition **'Trixx + Robert Haussmann | The Log-O-Rithmic Slide Rule: A Retrospective'** at the Nottingham Contemporary gallery. I don't usually visit galleries; in fact, I find them pretty sterile places in which to appreciate art and I try to avoid them (this is usually easy enough). It was...ok.

Is it necessary to know the artist or the context of artwork in order to criticise it? I don't think so, but it may just have been the reason why I didn't particularly enjoy it. Art is a confusing mess of rules. Except there are no rules. Except when there are. Gah!

So I did look them up after the fact. The designers in this case are a designer/architect duo. Searching online shows they have legendary status in the design community, and the handful of reviews I saw were all favourable.

If I'm honest I find that the gallery experience is on the whole _not the best way_ to appreciate art. I see art, or artistic merit, in a lot of things and I delight in it's discovery. Everything that exists has something to say, visually speaking. In a gallery, things can scream pretty loudly.

I feel as though this is an unpopular opinion.

Nevertheless, I picked out two items from the collection on which to comment.

<figure markdown="1">
![alt text](contemporary-001.jpg)
![alt text](contemporary-002.jpg)
</figure>

This piece is part of a group on display called **'Chair Fun'**. Is it fun?

If you say so.

Here we see three bistro chairs with their looped backs entangled. One red, one yellow, one blue. I did say previously that art in galleries screams loudly and all I can hear when I look at this is "HELP".

I can't help. If I reach out to untangle you I'll almost certainly be fined, perhaps even arrested.

<figure markdown="1">
![alt text](contemporary-003.jpg)
![alt text](contemporary-004.jpg)
</figure>

The second piece is a desk that looks like a Roman bridge. Each section of the desk actually opens up as a compartment, which is quite impressive from a craftsmanship perspective. It's wooden, but has a marble-style finished effect.

I wasn't really sure what to think of this beyond its function as a desk. I'm not a furniture enthusiast so I can't really comment on the techniques used, or how significant or relevant the style is - or was at the time of it's creation (it was designed in 1977). I honestly just look at it and can't help but notice that my legs wouldn't fit beneath the archway. It's bulky, looks heavy and would probably be a nightmare to get up a flight of stairs.

I'm being a bit unfair but sadly I feel totally ill-equipped to form valuable opinions on this kind of art. I'll definitely revisit the Contemporary though.

<p class="marker vf" markdown="1">findings</p>

In the Contemporary gift shop some cards in the revolving rack caught my eye.

<figure markdown="1">
![alt text](contemporary-005.jpg)

![alt text](contemporary-007.jpg)
</figure>

Each card shows a building or structure in a geometric thick line-art style. This style is similar to how I imagine pictographs working as part of a language - it's abstract enough to be seen as a combination of simple lines and shapes, but clearly identifiable as the things they represent. I didn't recognise these buildings as the real world places they are, but I immediately saw them _as buildings_.

The [Fifth Element](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/ has some great examples of hieroglyphics (created specifically for the movie) that have always stuck with me.

They illustrate the plot, including symbols for the elements earth, air, fire and water.

There was also [an entire language](https://www.divinelanguage.com/references.htm) (The Divine Language) created for the movie. Inspiring stuff.

I've had a quick play with letter forms (english) and how they can be abstracted in different ways but still hold their literary form. Not useful directly, but it was a fun little challenge.

<p class="marker vf" markdown="1">findings</p>

Something I saw of relevance a while back that is [Chineasy](https://www.chineasy.com/), a system for learning to read Chinese by using illustration to show the meaning of the written word within the letterform. It was created by London entrepreneur ShaoLan Hsueh.

<figure markdown="1">
	<img src="chineasy-001.png" srcset="chineasy-001@2x.png 2x">
</figure>

This is smart, and the illustrations themselves are great. Look at how similar 'person' and 'fire' are. Get it wrong and your conversation takes a puzzling, and worrying, turn. Chineasy makes it just that little easier to remember the difference.

<p class="marker lbm" markdown="1">reflection</p>

**I just thought...** would it be possible to create a game where the visual elements are made out of the language itself - like Chineasy?

Something I've seen before and seemed to resonate when taking on my Project 1 brief was Macej Ceglowski's [Argument for Slavic Pessimism](https://youtu.be/kErHiET5YPw?t=1097). The aim of the brief is to create a world of your own.
