### Paul Rand
The only knowledge I have of Paul Rand is that he designed the NeXT logo for Steve Jobs in the late 80s and was a major influence on 50s and 60s graphic design standards.

### David Carson
This guy broke the rules that had been set as industry standard by figures such as a Rand.

### Victor Papernack
Another influential figure in design.
