**TL;DR**
I spent two days creating a co-operative multiplayer card game called **Final Fleet**.

There's no doubt about it. There's a (link: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/rise-of-board-games text: board game resurgence popup:true) afoot. Some friends and I put our heads together over the course of a weekend to see if we could set a premise and construct for a quick, challenging card-based game for up to 4 players.

The game as it stands still requires some tweaking but I thought I'd share the process. It was fun, and it encouraged me to think in different terms about creating an experience.

###Construct and Theme

The ultimate goal was for the format and objective of the game to be quick and fun for up to 4 players. We wanted it to be collaborative and incorporate some aspect of deck building (players can strategically collect or redeem particular cards). There would also need to be enough variation within the game in order for it to play and _feel_ slightly differently each time, thus creating a desire for replayability.

Space seemed to suit the theme of deck building pretty well. At the time I wasn't familiar with the hugely popular (link: https://www.starrealms.com/ text: Star Realms popup:true), which if nothing else validates the marriage of deck building and intergalactic warfare.

###The Objective

From the outset we were keen to take on the challenge of developing a shared objective between the players; over the course of the game (a series of turn-based rounds) an enemy deck would build and gain in strength/resources in much the same way as a player. Loosely throwing ideas together on a blackboard we managed to round the general objective of a collaborative game as follows:

A group of up to 4 players each have defined roles that make up a combat fleet. The fleet, having declared war on four neighboring alien civilizations, is en route to an intergalactic battle several quadrants away. Over the course of several 'building' rounds the players take it in turns to both build their attack and defence power while at the same time drawing from a random encounter deck (the outcome of which may be positive or negative). During each round, an enemy deck of face-down cards is gradually building an enemy fleet in anticipation of the battle. This deck contains alien ships of all four alien races, each ship of a varying degree of strength against the allied fleet. After the deck building rounds are complete, the amassed enemy fleet is revealed and the allied fleet between them, in turns, must strategize effectively, targeting and destroying enemy ships until the battle is resolved.

###Gameplay

- From the outset players select a role card from the role deck. This is their role for the duration of the game.
- Different roles define different abilities or varying weapon and shield capacities.
- The player who draws the role with the highest rank is the leader of the fleet, and thus begins the first round of the game.
- Each role begins the game with a pre-defined number of weapons and shields.
- On a players turn, they draw a card from the encounter deck and share the outcome with the group. Types of encounter include meteor showers or enemy scouts.

###Inside the mind of a player

What do people want out of a collaborative game experience? What are the factors that generate excitement and enjoyment? What makes them feel engaged/involved? Here are just a few examples that I think apply here, and of course to other kinds of games and collaborative tasks.

- Feel like you've overcome a challenge
- Feel like you've worked together effectively as a group
- Feel like you've successfully strategised and beaten the odds
- Feel like you've been immersed in a story

Let's translate these points in to moments we want to create for our players:

- I can _**do this!**_
- Somebody _**help**_ me, I need bailing out...
- You collect _**this**_, I'll collect _**that**_ and then we're set.
- All we need is _**'X'**_. Then we'll be unstoppable!
- This is going to be tricky so _**let's think about this**_.

Creating these moments will involve a delicate balance of the feeling of **confidence** with the feeling of **uncertainty**. For this reason we introduced an encounter deck that would add an element of randomness to the pace and progress of the game. Another option for achieving this would have been to have a detractor (a player who deceptively does not want the group to succeed and who may perform subtle actions to influence the outcome while remaining undetected) but this was dismissed given our time constraints.

###Prototyping

Using large sheets of flipchart paper we drew out the cards we felt would be necessary components within the game. These were:

- Character/role cards
- Encounter cards
- Ship cards
- Weapon cards
- Shield cards
- Enemy fleet cards

###Getting the balance just right (a.k.a (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle text: The Goldilocks Principle))

Without a doubt the most painstaking part of the process, albeit with the greatest payoff. In a game where the challenge is dictated by the game itself as opposed to players defeating one another, finding the crucial balance between factors of success and failure, strategy and blind luck, effort and benefit was tricky to get exact. We tried to avoid the temptation to involve a dice-rolling mechanic. The way the enemy deck would gradually build and be revealed, along with the encounter cards, would ideally add enough randomness to the game to make it feel unpredictable at points along the way - but randomness is surprisingly difficult to structure. What we _didn't_ want was it to feel like Solitaire, a game that is beatable but only if cards are dealt with in a favourable sequence. _That_ was the sweet spot we wanted. Winning the game would be statistically possible every time but reliant on an effective strategy (switching strategies each game would be expected, with no clear 'bulletproof' strategy).

###Conclusion
As someone that is regularly involved in projects that aim to define effective user experiences in a web context this was a blast. If you're in a similar profession I'd honestly recommend giving it a shot; set yourself a time limit and the goal of creating an engaging, enjoyable game - all the tools you'd really need are pen and paper, but if you want to get more technical then there's no reason not to. Hell, if you're keen to discuss ideas then (link: https://aemail.com/Z6J text:get in touch popup:true). I'm all ears!
