However, I recently revisited the original codebase, upgraded from <a href='https://svelte.dev/' target='_blank'>Svelte</a> v2 to v3 (which are significantly different), and redressed the visual style of the components to be a little more polished. You can view the Bowler Docs <a href='https://bowler-docs.simonlayfield.now.sh/' target='_blank'>here</a> (just be aware that they are outdated).</p><figure><img src='/assets/img/portfolio/projects/bowler/bowler-page.jpg'></figure><figure><img src='/assets/img/portfolio/projects/bowler/bowler-page-002.png'></figure>"
