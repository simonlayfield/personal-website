  <small>By Nick Reese</small></div>

<p>If you're wondering if Elder.js will support your use case we have 1 good rule to help you make that decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you building a "<strong>website</strong>" which has mainly static, public content or are you building an "<strong>app</strong>" where users log in to do stuff and content is personalized?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're building a <strong>website</strong>, then Elder.js is a great solution out of the box.</p>
<p>If you're building an "App" you can definitely use Elder.js with hooks (make sure to look at the <a href="/middleware/"><code>middleware</code></a> hook) but you may also want to explore <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a> as there are lots of guides on authentication and other common needs for Apps.</p>
<h2 id="common-use-cases-for-elderjs">Common Use Cases for Elder.js</h2>
<p>The Elder.js project was born out of the system that powers <a href="https://elderguide.com/">ElderGuide.com</a>. When building Elder Guide we searched high and low for a blazing fast static site generator that we could use with Svelte, but couldn't find anything that fit our needs.</p>
<p>After 6 months of building a great system, we decided to polish it a bit more and open it up into a project others could use.</p>
<p>Today, Elder.js has two main functions: one as a static site generator and the other as <code>express</code> middleware where it acts as a Svelte framework that supports server side rendering (SSR) and partial hydration. (You're probably viewing this page on the <code>express</code> middleware version.)</p>
<p>All of this said, we highly recommend Elder.js as a tool for building statically generated sites that can be cheaply and securely hosted on S3, Netlify, or Cloudflare.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flagship SEO websites with 10,000s of pages</li>
<li>Blogs and personal websites</li>
<li>Portfolio or brochure websites</li>
</ul>
<p>To see static export in action run <code>npm run build</code> in your terminal. We think you'll be surprised how fast it builds. :)</p>
<p>If you are looking to use Elder.js as an <code>express</code> middleware make sure to look at the <a href="/middlewareRequest/"><code>middlewareRequest</code></a> hook as it should empower you to do anything you'd need to do with Express.</p>
<h2 id="what-parts-of-elderjs-arent-great">What Parts of Elder.js Aren't Great?</h2>
<p><strong>A Very Complex Rollup Config</strong></p>
<p>To be candid, Elder.js's biggest drawback is it's very complex Rollup configuration. Hours and hours of tinkering have gone into it and it's the best system we could come up with that works.</p>
<p>As of Elder.js v1.0.0 this config was internalized to Elder.js to help internalize much of the complexity.</p>
<p>That said, this means that if you need a different Rollup config than the standard, you'll need to do some hacking yourself.</p>
<p><strong>A Very Strict Folder Structure</strong></p>
<p>Because of Elder.js' complex Rollup config it needs to follow a pretty specific file structure. This project matches that file structure and you can learn more about it on the <a href="/getting-started/">getting started</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>Express Middleware / Server</strong></p>
<p>In the interest of being objective, it is worth noting that the 'server' functionality powered by Express like middleware was initially used as a 'previewer' to allow us to see pages of our statically generated site BEFORE waiting for 1,000s of pages to build.</p>
<p>Only later did we realize that others would be interested in the same functionality to build server rendered Svelte apps.</p>
<p><strong>No Live Reload / HMR support (Yet)</strong></p>
<p>We realize developer experience is crucial and see potential in using <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> to avoid bundling altogether during development, but we don't want to migrate to JavaScript's native ES Module (ESM) syntax on production just yet.</p>
